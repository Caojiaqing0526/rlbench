# Environments

- [ ] `info` property

## Testbeds 

- [ ] Chicken
- [ ] Gridworld
- [ ] Mountain Car

# Policies

- [ ] For off-policy, need to be able to get the probability of each action taken according to behavior and target policy
- [ ] Use this to reimplement `choose` so that it uses the policy's `probabilities` method 

# Features

# Algorithms

- [ ] Need to eventually wrap `Algorithm` objects in `Agent` objects
- [ ] Algorithm parameters should be ordered alphabetically, (perhaps defaulting to `None`?)

# Benchmarking

## Data Generation

- [ ] Basic data generation
- [ ] Data format spec for reproducibility
- [ ] 

## Consistency

- [ ] Reducing MDPs to matrix form and solving exactly
- [ ] Implement Monte Carlo solver (do you have this already?)
- [ ] Solving with value iteration
